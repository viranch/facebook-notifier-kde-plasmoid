This is a KDE plasmoid that shows facebook notifications
from the RSS feed of notifications from your facebook account.

It sits in the panel, and pops up if there is a new notification.
Clicking on a notification will open the relevant facebook page
in user's default browser.
Fun-fact: Clicking on the title in the plasmoid will take you
straight to facebook.com in your browser!

=INSTALL=========

Make sure you are running the KDE SC version >= 4.8.

Make and install the plasmoid package from source:

$ cd facebook-notifier-kde-plasmoid/
$ zip -r fbnotifier.plasmoid *
$ plasmapkg -i fbnotifier.plasmoid

The plasmoid is now installed and can now be added to the desktop/panel
from the widgets list.

The source directory can also be safely deleted.

=USAGE==========

After the plasmoid is added, go to "Facebook Notifier Settings" by
right-clicking on the plasmoid, and enter your facebook account's
RSS feed URL for notifications. To get the feed URL, open your facebook
account in a browser, open your notifications and go to "See All
Notifications". On the page that opens, find the line "Get notifications
via:" and copy the link address of the link "RSS" on that line.
Paste the URL in plasmoid's settings box and click OK. This is a
one-time procedure (whenever you add the plasmoid) and the notifications
will be synced on your desktop with an interval of one minute.
